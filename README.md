# TextEditor
## Instructions
You need to write a program similar to Notepad. The program will allow the user to type anything including Letters, digits, special characters. In as many rows as they want. 

The user then can save the text he/she wrote, then later on load it to continue working on. Your program must have the following features:

1.  Navigate the screen using the arrow keys (go up if there is text above the cursor and down if there is text below cursor, right if there is text on the right side of cursor and left if there is text on left side of cursor
2.  Cursor can not go outside screen. 
3.  User can save the document on disk in text format
4.  User can load a file into the editor. So if I have my own TEXT file, I can load it into your editor to read it and edit it
5.  User can manipulate text by adding, deleting and copy/pasting.
6.  Display a menu with the options/commands the user can use to operate your editor
